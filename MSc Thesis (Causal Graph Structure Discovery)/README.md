Codes:- Contains all codes created for this project

-----------------------------
1.Codes:-

1.1 simulating motions-- Contains notebook to create raw motion gifs. Total 16 files for 8 Fixed length robotic arm structures  and 8 for Dynamic length robotic arm structures
Generate 2. (raw motion) as outputs.

1.2 dataset_creation_direct_input_models-- Contains data creation and preprocessing files from raw motion gifs and output will be utilised by model architecture as the input data.
Inputs needed are stored in 2.

1.3 Model Notebooks-- contains all proposed architectures codes with their results
Inputs needed for these notebooks are generated as outputs of Python scripts in 1.2


Note:- Rest all filenames are self-explanatory for the functions they are responsible for.
